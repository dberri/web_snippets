A repository to store small CSS and JS snippets.

#### Hover Outline Animation
A transition applied to an image when hovered. An overlay fades in with a text and an outline drawing itself from the center.

#### Sliding Overlay
A transition applied when an image is hovered.<br>
There is an overlay at the bottom of the image with a title, and the transition slides this overlay to cover the entire image and shows more information about it.<br>
There is also small transitions with the info's underlines.

#### Image Hover Animation
Inspired by the Jackson Guitars website: https://www.jacksonguitars.com/gear/shape/rhoads <br>
When not in hover state, only part of the image is shown, with its container's overlay hidden. <br>
When in hover state, the image inside the container is scaled, translated and rotated 45Â° do fit the said container, so the entire image is shown.

ps: Not using best practices, like using a separated css file, only because they are really small snippets.

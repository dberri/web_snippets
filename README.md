#### Sliding Overlay
A transition applied when an image is hovered.<br>
There is an overlay at the bottom of the image with a title, and the transition slides this overlay to cover the entire image and shows more information about it.<br>
There is also small transitions with the info's underlines.

#### Image Hover Animation
Inspired by the Jackson Guitars website: https://www.jacksonguitars.com/gear/shape/rhoads <br>
When not in hover state, only part of the image is shown, with its container's overlay hidden. <br>
When in hover state, the image inside the container is scaled, translated and rotated 45Â° do fit the said container, so the entire image is shown.<br>
Also, a sliding information box slides in.

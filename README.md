#### Hover Outline Animation
A transition applied to an image when hovered. An overlay fades in with a text and an outline drawing itself from the center.

#### Image Hover Animation
Inspired by the Jackson Guitars website: https://www.jacksonguitars.com/gear/shape/rhoads
When not in hover state, only part of the image is shown, with its container's overlay hidden.
When in hover state, the image inside the container is scaled, translated and rotated 45Â° do fit the said container, so the entire image is shown.
